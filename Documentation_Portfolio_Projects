3 Two excel files were created as covidDeaths with the first 26 columns  and covidVaccinations with the remaining 37 columns, 

4 The first four columns are the same in both tables to enable us create relationships. 

5 Database was created for the project called CovidProject in Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition
